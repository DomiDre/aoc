Advent of Code - Training coding using Rust as language

This repo collects the crates written for solving each day of the AdventOfCode challenges that can be found by 
going to https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1 where 1 should be substituted by the day of choice!

I admit most solutions wont win any beauty contest as I always stopped once I had the answer.
